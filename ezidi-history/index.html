      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The Yazidis (Êzidî) are an ethno-religious minority indigenous to regions of present-day northern Iraq (especially Sinjar and Shekhan), Syria, Turkey, and Armenia, with a growing global diaspora. Their tradition blends ancient Mesopotamian, Zoroastrian, and other West Asian influences, forming a distinct monotheistic faith centered on reverence for God (Xwedê) and seven holy beings.</p>

    <section id="beliefs" class="panel">
      <h2>Beliefs & Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Monotheistic belief in one Creator (Xwedê).</li>
        <li>Veneration of seven archangels; Tawûsê Melek (Peacock Angel) is prominent as a symbol of stewardship and mercy.</li>
        <li>Pilgrimage to Lalish, a sacred valley in northern Iraq.</li>
        <li>Oral tradition: religious hymns (qewls) and stories transmitted by trained reciters.</li>
        <li>Community structures historically organized by caste roles (e.g., sheikhs, pîrs, murids).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Mischaracterizations have fueled prejudice; understanding Yazidi theology in its own context is essential for respectful dialogue.</p>

      <h2>2014 Genocide (Sinjar)</h2>
      <p>In August 2014, ISIS (Islamic State) forces attacked Yazidi communities in the Sinjar (Şingal) region. Thousands were killed or abducted; women and girls were subjected to sexual slavery; boys were forcibly indoctrinated; mass graves were created. The assault displaced an estimated hundreds of thousands, many fleeing to Mount Sinjar where they faced starvation and dehydration before humanitarian corridors were established.</p>
      <p>International bodies, including the United Nations, the European Parliament, and governments such as the United States, have recognized these acts as genocide. Documentation continues to identify perpetrators, exhume mass graves, and support prosecutions.</p>
