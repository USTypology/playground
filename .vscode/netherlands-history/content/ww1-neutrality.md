The Netherlands maintained a policy of neutrality during World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918. This decision was rooted in a long-standing tradition of neutrality that the country had upheld since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. 

Despite being surrounded by warring nations, the Dutch government sought to avoid involvement in the conflict, focusing instead on maintaining peace and stability within its borders. This neutrality was not without challenges, as the country faced pressures from both the Allied and Central Powers.

The Dutch military was mobilized to defend the nation's borders, but the government emphasized diplomatic efforts to navigate the complexities of international relations during the war. The Netherlands served as a refuge for those fleeing the conflict, including many Belgians who sought safety from the fighting.

Economically, the war had mixed effects on the Netherlands. While some industries benefited from increased demand for goods, others faced shortages and disruptions due to the blockade imposed by the Allies. The government implemented measures to manage these challenges, including rationing and price controls.

In the aftermath of the war, the Netherlands emerged with its sovereignty intact, having avoided the devastation experienced by many of its neighbors. The experience of maintaining neutrality during World War I would influence Dutch foreign policy in the years to come, reinforcing the commitment to peace and diplomacy in international affairs.
