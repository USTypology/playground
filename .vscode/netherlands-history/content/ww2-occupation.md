## Occupation of the Netherlands during World War II

The occupation of the Netherlands during World War II began on May 10, 1940, when German forces invaded the country. The Dutch military was quickly overwhelmed, and by May 15, the Netherlands had surrendered. The occupation lasted until May 5, 1945, when the country was liberated by the Allies.

### Initial Occupation

Following the invasion, the German authorities implemented strict control over the Dutch population. The Dutch government fled to London, and the country was placed under military administration. The Nazis aimed to exploit the Netherlands for its strategic location and resources.

### Resistance and Collaboration

Throughout the occupation, various forms of resistance emerged. Many Dutch citizens engaged in acts of defiance, including hiding Jews and sabotaging German operations. The most notable resistance group was the Dutch National Socialist Movement, which collaborated with the Nazis, leading to a complex relationship between collaboration and resistance within the Dutch society.

### Impact on the Jewish Community

The occupation had devastating effects on the Jewish population in the Netherlands. Approximately 75% of the Dutch Jews were deported to concentration camps, where most perished. The systematic persecution of Jews was a significant aspect of the Nazi regime's policies in the Netherlands.

### Liberation

The liberation of the Netherlands began in late 1944, with the Allies making significant advances. The final liberation occurred on May 5, 1945, when German forces in the Netherlands surrendered unconditionally. The end of the occupation marked a new beginning for the Dutch people, who faced the challenges of rebuilding their nation in the aftermath of the war.

### Conclusion

The occupation of the Netherlands during World War II remains a critical chapter in Dutch history, characterized by suffering, resistance, and resilience. The experiences of this period continue to shape the national identity and collective memory of the Dutch people today.
